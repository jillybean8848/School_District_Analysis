#School_District_Analysis

##Overview

The school board has noticed that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have reached out for assistance. I was asked to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. After replacing the math and reading scores, the process was repeated to show how the changes affected the overall analysis.

After reviewing the average scores and passing percentages among high schools within the district the average math score dropped 0.1 and the average reading score was unaffected. The percentage of those passing math dropped 1% and the percentage of those passing reading also dropped 1%.

After reviewing the school summaries as well as the highest and lowest performing schools we can see that the score corrections affected the ranking of the top five performing schools. Previously, Thomas High School ranked second place in the top five performing schools with a 91% overall passing percentage. However, once revisions were made for the math and reading scores, Thomas High School was no longer in the top five now with a 65% overall passing percentage. Interestingly, the five lowest performing schools remained the same.
